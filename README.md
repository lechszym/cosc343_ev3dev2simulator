# ev3dev2simulator: simulator for the EV3 (ev3dev2 API)

The behaviour of the EV3 robot is simulated in the simulator. This is convenient to quickly test programs when you momentarily donâ€™t have access to an EV3.

You can use the 'ev3dev2' python library to program the EV3. The simulator installs a fake 'ev3dev2' library on the PC. When using this library on the PC, every call to this API is forwarded to the simulator which uses it to simulate the behaviour of the EV3 robot. 

For an example see: https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/thonny-ev3dev/wiki/Simulator-example<br>
The running program can be seen in the following video: http://www.cs.ru.nl/lab/ev3dev2simulator.html .

The thonny-ev3dev plugin makes it easier to program the EV3 programmable LEGO brick 
using the [Thonny Python IDE for beginners](http://thonny.org/). 
The thonny-ev3dev plugin for the Thonny IDE comes with the ev3dev2simulator.

## Getting started

   Clone the repository to your hardrive
   
      git clone https://github.com/lechszym/cosc343_ev3dev2simulator.git
    
   Then change cd into the new created folder

      cd cosc343_ev3dev2simulator

   Activate the anaconda cosc343 environment
   
      conda activate cosc343

   Then you can just run the simulator by running the following script (remember, you must be in the root folder of the git repo):
   
      python cosc343_a1_simulator.py -t foyer_cosc343.yaml

## Using the simulator

The user guide of the simulator can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/ev3dev2simulator/wiki).
